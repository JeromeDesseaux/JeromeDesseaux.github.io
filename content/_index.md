# Hello ðŸ‘‹

**Welcome to 'notes for later' !**

Notes For Later is a personal blog & wiki. It has been named from a song "Notes pour trop tard" [eng: Notes for too late] from Orelsan. A french rapper I like. 

Similar to traditionals notes, it's a container for various kind of content that may even be unrelated to each other. Ideas are not refined. Thoughts are not tailored. I write what I think, what I need, and what I think that may help you. 


This website is not analyzed. If I get some readers (and I'm glad to!) I don't want them to get tracked by Google or any company that use your data to sell things about yourself. I don't care about those data. If what I wrote has been useful to you, feel free to email me. It's always a pleasure.
